In this class, I learned different techniques of storing, accessing and processing data as utilized in the development of programs and algorithms. The programs are made using lists, stacks, queues, trees, recursion and graphs. Algorithms for applications such as sorting, searching and merging will be analyzed and implemented. Solutions are designed using object-oriented techniques and implemented in the Java programming language.
